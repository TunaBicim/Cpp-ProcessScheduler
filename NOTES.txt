processesN.txt files are sample inputs of your program with N processes
Copy processesN.txt to your project directory and rename it as processes.txt

sampleOutputN_X.txt files are the expected outputs for processesN.txt using X for RQ (linked list or binary search tree)
Your algorithm's performance parameters might be slightly different from sample output. Process execution order should not.

You don't need to store your code's outputs as text files. However, you do need to run your code on sample inputs and comment on your results, either in a separate text file or in your main.cpp
